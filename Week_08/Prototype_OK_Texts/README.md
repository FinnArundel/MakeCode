## for OK Text

### - a Brutal Interactive "Technological Determinism" Experience

OK text is a literal representation of the term “Technological Determinism”. I’m trying to emphasis the helplessness and cruelty of Mark Amerika’s words. 

I interpreted the first statement of the OK Text as a warning to the audience, suggesting that the incoming Technological Determinism statements can cause viewer great pain, so I kept it as a warning screen to let user know to proceed with caution.

To create great contrast between a harmless webpage and the cruelty of the technological determinism statements, I’ve planned to have random broken-up texts floating on screen. After testing I’ve determined that four randomly selected and scrambled sentences can form a better experience when displayed on a typical browser screen. The floating texts can react to mouse movement (effect not yet determined).

When user decided to interact, by clicking anywhere on the canvas, a sentence (from the original text) will form by assembling scrambled words. The word that not assembled will fly off the screen, leaving user the statement, the prompt and only one button to continue - OK.

> The floating words represent the seemingly nativity of plain technology, which covering the “great pain“ it caused when the technology were enabled with the ability of determine the society.

After pressing the ok button, the screen goes black and four more sets of randomly selected statement will display on a black background. 

> The background will switch between black and white with each OK click.

## Potential Expansions

### 1. Cruel Statement Generator (Prototype V0.1)

1. In the early phase of prototyping, I’ve created a random cruel statement generator, which contains the basic structure of sentences, with words extracted and filled from a randomiser database. Please see below demonstration.

3. > **Prototype Transcript:**
   >
   > Your **partner** is **leaving you** because **of your incompetence of taking care of things**. **Do nothing**? →
   >
   > Your **friend** is **heartbroken** because **you're selfish and never considered others**. **Acting hysterical**?
   >
   > You **were selected to fly free for a lifetime**, but **couldn't accept in time** because  **you were still hang over from the binge drinking last night**. **Cry in bed**? →
   >
   > You **pitched Netflix and they decided to buy your show**, but **you've missed the final call** because **your partner asked you to go to the servo to pick up dog food**. **Drown in regrets**?

### 2. Easter Egg(s)

1. I’m particularly interested in constantly rising the number of the transfer amount from the statement “A transfer of $247,789.40 is about to download”. It creates an urgency and can create a greater contrast when user finds out that the prompt to action is to close the connection.
